# HousingPriceModels
Analysis performed within group projects at Edinburgh University. 

The dataset: housing data for an American city, including 29 house features such as bedroom area and number of floors. 

Report 1: This report evaluates two classification models which predict whether a house will sell for more or less than the average market price. The first model implemented is a logistic regression model which uses all the available features, folllowed by a Naive Bayes model using only five features. Model performance was evaluated under 10-fold cross validation. 

Report 2: This report evaluates 5 quantitative models which predict the sale price of a property based on information about the property. Initially, a linear regression model is formulated and developed. Next, variable selection is performed to identify a minumum number of features which might contribute to successful model. Finally, three further models are fitted using a dataset with additional feature information- a simple linear regression, a lasso and a random forest. Leave one out cross validation was used throughout as a model performance metric.
